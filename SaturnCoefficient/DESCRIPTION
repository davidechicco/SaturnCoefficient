Description: A function that reads an input matrix, its dimensionality reduction produced by UMAP, and evaluates the quality of this dimensionality reduction by producing a real value in the [0; 1] interval. We call this real value Saturn coefficient. A higher value means better dimensionality reduction; a lower value means worse dimensionality reduction.
